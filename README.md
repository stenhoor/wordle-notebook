# wordle-notebook
This notebook is primarily intended as a coding example using Python and Pandas to automate filtering and processing of a dataset containing a number of strings.  It also has a secondary use of assisting in the filtering and sorting of wordle-style puzzles, such as those found at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
